Boringdroid is an `AOSP` extending project based on `AOSP`(9.0 - 11.0), and it provides a minimum patchset to use multi-window in `AOSP` by default. The patch set is boring, and most of problems the patchset resolves look like they are disappearing on `master` branch, so the project is boring, that the reason I calls it Boringdroid.

The boringdroid adds a minimize button for each window, and provides a smooth resizing experience. Boringdroid also provides an enhanced taskbar to show running task list and installed app list. The next steps for Boringdroid will be to provide system tray functionalities in the taskbar.
